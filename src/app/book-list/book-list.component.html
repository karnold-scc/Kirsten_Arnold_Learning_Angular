<!-- Async pipe imputted by Matt
We need the async pipe becasue The *ngFor directive cannot directly iterate over an Observable. It needs to be subscribed
to or used with the async pipe.

We havent learned this yet, but thats okay-->
<div *ngFor="let book of bookList | async; let i=index">
  <app-book-listitem [book]="book" [ngClass]="{'even-item' : i%2 === 0, 'odd-item' : i%2 === 1}"></app-book-listitem>
</div>
